                    <p>
                        Today woke up a little bit early (habitually I am very late ðŸ™ƒ) took a cold shower then had my breakfast,
                        listened to some classical music with black coffee.
                    
                        As the submission deadline is very near made some improvements to our paper. 
                        Spent a busy schedule at office as today is the last day of the sprint. 
                        Finished my office took mild coffee with snacks. Had some phone conversation with my parents and friends. 
    
                        Next month my GRE schedule, focused ~1.5-2.00 hours on GRE study. 
                        Saw some scholar's amazing research work, bookmarked some papers on my reading list. 
                        I am very gloomy because the list becoming heavy gradually ðŸ˜” need to clean my reading list.
                    </p>
                    <b>20th May</b>
                    <p>
                        Today was not good for me. The last few days I did not use my spectacles properly so the result 
                        is felt so much migraine headache from the morning. It was very difficult to concentrate on work 
                        with migraine pain. Feel very sad ðŸ˜¢ to hear one of my friend's father is COVID(+) and hospitalized 
                        with low oxygen saturation and other symptoms.
                    </p>
                    <b>21th May</b>
                    <p>
                        Feel quite good today ðŸ¤˜ not that much headache now using eyeglasses properly. 
                        Today was the last day of the week, did two long meetings with colleagues. 
                        Today had the first mangoes of this season and the taste was amazing ðŸ‘Œ. 
                    </p>
                    <b>22th May</b>
                    <p>
                        Today woke up very late as today was the day one of the weekends. 
                        Finished some scheduled tasks. The great news is my friend (Aquaman) disentangle from  
                        42 days of quarantine (Srilanka + Singapore). I did not put that much time into GRE study ðŸ˜¢. 
                        Today read some papers from my bucket list ðŸ¤˜.
                        <blockquote>

                               "Isnâ€™t it strange <br>
                                How people can change <br>
                                From strangers to friends <br>
                                Friends into lovers <br>

                    </blockquote>
                        Today I have listened to this song over and over. The music of this song is kind of addictive and 
                        Celeste's vocal tone make the lyric more fastening and convincing. 
                    </p>
                    <b>23th May</b>
                    <p>
                        Today is the last day of the weekends. 
                        Did not do that much task, I had just done some regular tasks. 
                        I planned to outside for a while, but the temperature was too high(~36-37) 
                        so compelled to cancel the plan.

                    <p>
                        Last two days I did not write anything, had gone everything well. 
                        Did my regular office work and study.  As today was a public holiday tried to concentrate 
                        little bit on my research work. Read some paper from a bucket list. 
                        Made a fruitful discussion with my collaborator (beautiful and cool mined person).

                        Headaches come back again took a half-day off from the office. 
                        Feel that it is very urgent to make an appointment (the last few days I was planning) 
                        with a specialist but somehow always fear comes into my subconscious mind because of 
                        some previous sad experience. In the evening took a light pain medicine now the headaches 
                        mitigates a little bit.

                    <p>
                        Finally, today went to an ophthalmology specialist. 
                        After entering the doctor's room, he made a good conversation with me and listened 
                        to all of the problems of mine. Then checked my eye with a bright light and made some notes. 
                        In the eye vision test exam I have passed with -0.75 (left) previous was (-.50) and -1.00 (right) 
                        previous was (-.75) focusing power. Gave two eye drops and medicines. Also, suggested to take 
                        stream inhalation in lukewarm water. 
                    </p>
